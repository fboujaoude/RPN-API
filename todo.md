### Todo

- [ ] Create a Custom class for the return so we can customize the result
- [ ] (Deppendency injection) Add a In Memory Repo by Creating an interface and register it as Singleton to be used instead of static DB class


###Raccourcies

- [ ] Use static DB variable based on session instead of DB
- [ ] More Exceptions handling
- [ ] (Not sure if needed in the requirements ) Should create a Stack map that can take double or string to handle the whole formula but i started my logic in another way and found at the end that i may change it all and idn't had time
