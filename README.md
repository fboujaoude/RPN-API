# RPN-Api

I did the test in 2 hours yesterday and had pushed it to the "main" branch.


# (Personal effort) 
I was hesitating to do this step, as i was affraid you think i am trying to cheat , but please let me tell you what is it about.
I added today this readme file and want to explain the below:

The test can be treated in different ways, and there was conflicts in naming "operand" and "operators" in the given context,and that took some extra time from me 
to decide the better approach for the solution.

So in the Next 30 mins after finishing the test,  i added dependencyInjection for the repository and changed some classes and fixed some methods,and in order not to change 
the "main" branch and appear as cheating i created a new branch and added the changes to it .
(Again this is personal effort that you can ignore but i appreciate if you can take a look at it just for having your opinion as professionals)
